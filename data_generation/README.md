# Creating a synthetic dataset
Note that this readme is just a simplified version if you want to take a look at our data generation strategy.
## V-Rep (Optional)
Download V-rep, the current setup used version 3.6.2 and can be found
in the [link](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/previousversions.html)

Open V-rep by going to the folder where you downloaded it, and launch it using the command ```./vrep.sh```

Then, load the simulation by going to file &rarr; open scene and retrieve the environment in ```simulation/simulation_New.ttt```

Please install assimp package to convert the .stl to .obj via ```sudo apt-get install assimp-utils```
