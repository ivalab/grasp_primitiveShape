<h1>Script editor</h1>


<p>The script editor allows editing the various scripts in V-REP. It is opened by double-clicking a script in the <a href="scriptProperties.htm">script dialog</a>, or by double-clicking a script icon in the <a href="userInterface.htm#SceneHierarchy">scene hierarchy</a>.<br>
</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Script editor]</p>
<br>

<p>The script editor has following features that make the code edition easier:</p>
<li>auto-completion</li>
<li>call tips</li>
<li>syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Highlighting of all occurrences of the selected word</li>
<li>source folding/unfolding</li>
<li>search and replace function</li>
<li>no need for explicit saving</li>
<li>jump to specific function</li>
<li>undo/redo</li>
<li>inspection/edition of included files</li>

<p>The API functions can easily be accessed by typing the first 3 letters (usually &quot;sim&quot;). When a script was modified, there is no need to explicitly save the changes: closing the script editor, saving the scene or starting a <a href="simulation.htm">simulation</a> will automatically apply the changes to the script. When a simulation is running, modifications to a given script will only have an effect once a new simulation run is started, except for <a href="customizationScripts.htm">customization scripts</a> that will always apply changes once the editor was closed. The user can also explicitely restart/reset a given script, for changes to take immediately effect.</p>

<p>If you have recurring functions you wish to access from a given script, or if you simply wish to run code from an external file, you can do this with following:</p>

<pre class=lightRedBox>
require "myExternalLuaFile"
</pre>

<p>In that case, make sure the file is named <em>myExternalLuaFile.lua</em>, and do not forget to distribute it together with your scene or model, since that code will not be part of a V-REP file anymore. Searched path are usually following:</p>
<li><em>&lt;V-REP executable&gt;/</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;V-REP executable&gt;/lua/</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;current scene path&gt;/</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;additional search path&gt;/</em> (this path can be specified with variable <em>additionalLuaPath</em> in file <em>system/usrset.txt</em>)</li>
<p>Files included via the <em>require</em> directive can be opened in the same script editor by opening the popup menu over the file name.</p>
