<h1>BlueZero Interface</h1>

<p>The BlueZero interface is part of the <a href="apisOverview.htm">V-REP API framework</a>. It wraps into a V-REP plugin the <a href="https://github.com/blueworkforce/bluezero" target="_blank">BlueZero (B&Oslash;) framework</a>. You can recognize BlueZero API functions from the <em>simB0</em> prefix.</p>

<p>B&Oslash; is a cross-platform middleware which provides tools for interconnecting pieces of software running in multiple threads, multiple processes and even multiple machines. It has some similarities with ROS, although it only focuses on providing communication paradigms (client/server and publisher/subscriber) and message transport (based on ZeroMQ), while being agnostic to message serialization format or common protocols and data structures.</p>

<p>V-REP can act as a one or several B&Oslash; nodes that other nodes can communicate with via B&Oslash; services, B&Oslash; publishers and B&Oslash; subscribers.</p>

<p>The BlueZero Interface functionality in V-REP is enabled via a plugin: <em>v_repExtBlueZero.dll, libv_repExtBlueZero.so</em> or <em>libv_repExtBlueZero.dylib</em>. The code to the plugin, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/CoppeliaRobotics/v_repExtBlueZero" target="_blank">here</a>, can easily be adapted to your own needs. The plugin is loaded when V-REP is launched, but you should make sure to have <em>b0_ resolver</em> running. Make sure to inspect V-REP's console window or terminal for details on plugin load operations. Various BlueZero tools can be found already compiled in the V-REP folder.</p>

<p>Have a look at following simulation scene for a quick start with the BlueZero interface:</p>
