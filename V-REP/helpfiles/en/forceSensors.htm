<h1>Force sensors <img src="images/forceSensors1.jpg"></h1>

<p>Force sensors are initially rigid links between two <a href="shapes.htm">shapes</a> that are able to measure transmitted forces and torques. The rigidity of force sensors is conditional, in the sense that force sensors can be <em>broken</em> if a certain condition arises (e.g. if a force or torque threshold is overshot). Following figure illustrates an application using a force sensor:<br>

<br>

<p>A force sensor measures a pair of 3 values representing the force on the sensor along the x-, y- and z-axis, and the torque on the sensor about the x-, y- and z-axis:<br>

<br>

<p>Initially, a force sensor acts as a rigid link. During <a href="simulation.htm">simulation</a>, a force sensor can however be <em>broken</em> when a specified force/torque threshold is overshot or when some other user-defined conditions are met. Following figures illustrate the <em>broken</em> state of a force sensor:<br>

<p>A force sensor is only operational during simulation if it is dynamically enabled. For more information on dynamically enabled force sensors, refer also to the section on <a href="designingDynamicSimulations.htm">designing dynamic simulations</a>. <a href="joints.htm">Joints</a> are also able to measure a force or a torque, however only along/about their z-axis. </p>


<p>Force sensors are added to the <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a> with [Menu bar --&gt; Add --&gt; Force sensor].<br>
