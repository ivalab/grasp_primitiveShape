<h1>Vision sensor types and mode of operation</h1>


<p><a href="visionSensors.htm">Vision sensors</a> come in 2 different types and can be adjusted for different purposes:
</p>

<li><strong>Orthographic projection-type</strong>: the field of view of orthographic projection-type vision sensors is rectangular. They are well suited for close-range infrared sensors, or laser range finders.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Perspective projection-type</strong>: the field of view of perspective projection-type vision sensors is trapezoidal. They are well suited for camera-type sensors.<br>
</li>

<br>

<p>Vision sensors, which are <a href="viewableObjects.htm">viewable objects</a>, can be <em>looked-through</em> like <a href="cameras.htm">camera objects</a> [Popup menu --&gt; View --&gt; Associate view with selected vision sensor]. See also the section on <a href="pagesAndViews.htm">pages and views</a> for more details.</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Vision sensor and various filters]</p>
<br>

<p>Vision sensors are very powerful in the sense that they can be used in various and flexible ways. For instance they can be used to display still or moving images from an external application or a <a href="plugins.htm">plugin</a>. Plugins can also provide customized image processing algorithms (e.g. filters) as well as evaluation algorithms (e.g. triggering conditions). There are several built-in filters that can be applied to images of a vision sensor. Refer to the <a href="visionSensorFilterComposition.htm">filter composition</a> section for more details.<br>
</p>

<p>Vision sensors can only render (and detect) <a href="renderableObjects.htm">renderable</a> <a href="entities.htm">entities</a>. Calculation results of vision sensors can be recorded by graph objects. Refer to <a href="graphs.htm">graphs</a> and <a href="dataStreamTypes.htm">graph data stream types</a> for more information about how to record vision sensor data.
