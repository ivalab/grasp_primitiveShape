Description 
</td> 
<td class=apiTableRightDescr>Allows specifying the exact moment at which the current thread should switch to another thread. If the current script doesn't run in a thread (i.e. if it runs in the application main thread), this function has no effect. By default, V-REP doesn't use &quot;regular&quot; threads, but something similar to hybrid threads (which behave like coroutines, but can also behave like regular threads). This allows much more flexibility and execution control of the threads: each thread (except for the main or application thread) has a switch timing associated, which specifies how long the thread will run before switching to other threads. By default this value is 2 millisecond, but can be modified with <a href="simSetThreadSwitchTiming.htm">sim.setThreadSwitchTiming</a>. That timing can be shortened with <a href="simSwitchThread.htm">sim.switchThread</a>. Use with care when calling this function from a plugin. See also the <a href="simSetThreadAutomaticSwitch.htm">sim.setThreadAutomaticSwitch</a>, <a href="simSetThreadResumeLocation.htm">sim.setThreadResumeLocation</a> and <a href="simSetThreadIsFree.htm">sim.setThreadIsFree</a> functions.<br></td>
