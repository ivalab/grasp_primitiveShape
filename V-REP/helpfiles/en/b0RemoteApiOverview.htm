<h1>B&Oslash;-based remote API</h1>

<p class=warningBox>The B&Oslash;-based remote API should not be mixed-up with the <a href="legacyRemoteApiOverview.htm">legacy remote API</a> (or simply <em>remote API</em>) which is an older version of the remote API that is less flexible, and more difficult to extend.</p>

<p>The B0-based remote API is part of the <a href="apisOverview.htm">V-REP API framework</a>.</p>

<p>The B0-based remote API allows to control a simulation (or the simulator itself) from an external application or a remote hardware (e.g. real robot, remote computer, etc.). The V-REP B0-based remote API is composed by <a href="b0RemoteApi-functionList.htm">approximately one hundred specific functions</a> and <a href="b0RemoteApi-cpp.htm#simxCallScriptFunction">one generic function</a>, that can be called from a C++ application, a Python script, a Java application, a Matlab program, or a Lua script. The B0-based remote API functions are interacting with V-REP via the <a href="https://github.com/blueworkforce/bluezero" target="_blank">BlueZero middleware</a> and its  <a href="blueZeroPlugin.htm">interface plugin</a> to V-REP. All this happens in a hidden fashion to the user. The remote API can let one or several external applications interact with V-REP in a synchronous* or asynchronous* way (asynchronous by default), and even remote control of the simulator is supported (e.g. remotely loading a scene, starting, pausing or stopping a simulation for instance).</p>

<p class=warningBox>The word <em><strong>Synchronous</strong></em> is used in the sense that each simulation pass runs synchronously with the remote API application (i.e. the simulator will wait for a trigger signal from a client to start next simulation pass at a time t+dt). This is different from synchronous/asynchronous in the sense of <em>blocking/non-blocking operation</em>. The remote API also supports blocking and non-blocking operations.<br>
</p>


<p>Make sure you understand how the B0-based remote API is operating by reading <a href="b0RemoteApiModusOperandi.htm">this section</a>. Also have a look at the <a href="externalControllerTutorial.htm">external controller tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The B0-based remote API functionality comes in 2 separate entities, that are interacting via the BlueZero framework:</p>

<li><strong>the client side (i.e. your application)</strong>: the B0-based remote API on the client side is available for many different programming languages. Currently following languages are supported: <a href="b0RemoteApi-cpp.htm">C++</a>, <a href="b0RemoteApi-python.htm">Python</a>, <a href="b0RemoteApi-java.htm">Java</a>, <a href="b0RemoteApi-matlab.htm">Matlab</a> and <a href="b0RemoteApi-lua.htm">Lua</a>. Bindings for other languages can easily be created by yourself. <a href="b0RemoteApiClientSide.htm">Instructions on how to enable the B0-based remote API on the client side are given here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>the server side (i.e. V-REP)</strong>: the B0-based remote API on the server side is implemented via a V-REP plugin and a Lua script (<a href="https://github.com/CoppeliaRobotics/lua/blob/master/b0RemoteApiServer.lua" target="_blank">lua/b0RemoteApiServer.lua</a>). The plugin should be loaded by V-REP at start-up: v_repExtBlueZero.dll, libv_repExtBlueZero.dylib or libv_repExtBlueZero.so. The plugin project files are located <a href="https://github.com/CoppeliaRobotics/v_repExtBlueZero" target="_blank">here</a>. <a href="b0RemoteApiServerSide.htm">Instructions on how to enabled the remote API on the server side are given here</a>.</li>
