<h1>Mirrors <img src="images/mirrors1.jpg"> <img src="images/mirrors2.jpg"></h1>


<p>The mirror objects in V-REP can have two distinct functions:</p>
<li>they can act as mirrors and will reflect images/light</li>
<li>they can also act as  auxiliary clipping planes. A clipping plane forbids rendering past a specific plane in space, effectively &quot;cutting&quot; into the view and allowing to look inside of closed objects. The clipping plane function can be applied to the whole <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a>, or to a specific <a href="entities.htm">entity</a>.</li>

<p>Following images illustrate the dual functions of mirrors:</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Mirror functions: a) as regular mirrors, b) as auxiliary clipping planes]</p>
<br>

<p>The effect of mirrors can be seen when looking through a <a href="cameras.htm">camera</a>, or when displaying the image content of a <a href="visionSensors.htm">vision sensor</a> (since mirrors are <a href="renderableObjects.htm">renderable objects</a>). Old graphic cards might not correctly support mirrors.</p>
<p>Use mirrors with caution: they slow down the scene display, and won't reflect other mirrors. You can however have as many mirrors as needed. Clipping planes on the other hands are limited to a maximum of 5, or even less depending on your graphic card capabilities.
</p>


<p>Mirrors are added to the <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a> with [Menu bar --&gt; Add --&gt; Mirror].<br>
