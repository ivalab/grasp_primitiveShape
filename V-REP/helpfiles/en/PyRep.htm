<h1>PyRep</h1>

<p>PyRep is a toolkit for robot learning research, built on top of V-REP. It allows to launch V-REP's simulation thread from Python. Because of this, one is able to execute PyRep python code synchronously with the simulation loop, thus greatly increasing speed compared to a Python client that would interact with V-REP via remote procedure calls. This is particularly interesting fo rlearning algorithms in the areas of reinforcement learning, imitation learning, state estimation, etc.. PyRep was written and is courtesy by Stephen James (Imperial College London).</p>
<p>PyRep install and usage examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep">PyRep repository</a>.</p>
