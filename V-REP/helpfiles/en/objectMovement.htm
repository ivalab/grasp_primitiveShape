<h1>Object movement with the mouse</h1>


<p>Next to modifying <a href="objects.htm">object</a> configurations through the <a href="coordinateDialog.htm">coordinate and transformation dialog</a>, objects can also directly be manipulated using the mouse: when objects (and some items) are selected, then they can be translated or rotated using following toolbar buttons:<br>
</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Manipulation toolbar buttons (position and orientation)]</p>
<br>

<p>By default, translation is performed in the  world's X-Y plane. It can also be performed along a different axis/plane and relative to a different reference frame for each individual object, depending on the settings in the <a href="positionDialog.htm">position dialog</a>. A cyan overlay drawing indicates the current translation plane or axis.<br>
</p>

<p>By default, rotation is performed around the object's own Z axis. It can also be performed around a different axis or relative to a different reference frame for each individual object, depending on the settings in the <a href="orientationDialog.htm">orientation dialog</a>. A cyan overlay drawing indicates the current rotation axis.<br>
</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Object translation and rotation operations with the mouse: the cyan overlay drawing indicates the translation plane or rotation axis]</p>

<p>Default translation and rotation step sizes (snapping) can be adjusted in the <a href="settings.htm">user settings dialog</a>, but it is recommended to keep values of 5 centimeters and 5 degrees respectively, or to set the step sizes for objects on an individual basis. Snapping can temporarily be disabled by holding down the shift-key <strong>AFTER</strong> the mouse button was pressed down during object manipulation. In a similar way, alternative translation or rotation axes can be temporarily activated by holding down the ctrl-key <strong>AFTER</strong> the mouse button was pressed down during object manipulation.<br>
</p>

<p>The object/item translation toolbar button can also be used when the simulator is in the <a href="vertexEditMode.htm">vertex edit mode</a> or in the <a href="pathEditMode.htm">path edit mode</a>.<br>
