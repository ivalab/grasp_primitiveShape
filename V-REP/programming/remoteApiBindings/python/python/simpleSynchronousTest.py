# This small example illustrates how to use the remote API
# synchronous mode. The synchronous mode needs to be
# pre-enabled on the server side. You would do this by
# starting the server (e.g. in a child script) with:
#
# simRemoteApi.start(19999,1300,false,true)
#
# But in this example we try to connect on port
# 19997 where there should be a continuous remote API
# server service already running and pre-enabled for
# synchronous mode.
#
#
# IMPORTANT: for each successful call to simxStart, there
# should be a corresponding call to simxFinish at the end!
