# BlueZero v2

BlueZero (in short, "B0") is a cross-platform middleware which provides tools for interconnecting pieces of software running in multiple threads, processes or machines.

It has some similarities with ROS, although it only focuses on providing communication paradigms (client/server and publisher/subscriber) and message transport (based on ZeroMQ), while being agnostic to message serialization format or common protocols and data structures.

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
